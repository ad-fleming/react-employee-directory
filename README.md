  # React Employee Search 
  
  ## Description
  This project uses React and React Router to allow users to navigate to a search page, which is then populated by axios search results from the _randomuser.me_ api. It uses class components to track state and dynamically render users to the page which can then be filtered dynamically via the search bar.
